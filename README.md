**Smith-Waterman via command-line:**

This code runs a local alignment using the Smith-Waterman algorithm. 
Sequences must have length between 5 - 50

The scoring function used is:
s(i,j) = {+2 if i and j match, -1 if mismatch}, gamma(g) = -2

In order to run this code: 
- python 3.7.6 or higher should be enabled
- the input file must be located in the same folder as the executable
- the command prompt location should be in the same folder as the executable
- numpy and re python libraries must be installed

Steps to run:
- via command-line, navigate to /algorithms within your repository
- use command: <ADD COMMAND>


**Needleman-Wunsch via command-line:**
